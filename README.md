#### Description

This project is a single-page Wedding Website designed to showcase my web development skills as part of the final project for the CS50x course. It aims to be both functional and aesthetically appealing, with interactive features that engage users. The website serves as a hub for my upcoming wedding, featuring key information for guests while demonstrating my proficiency with front-end and back-end technologies.

The site includes the following sections:

Homepage: An introductory section with an engaging welcome message.
Schedule: Details about the wedding weekend schedule.
RSVP: A form where guests can confirm attendance.


#### index.html
The HTML page that contains the password form for users to enter. 

#### home.html
The primary HTML file for the website. It contains the structure and layout of the webpage, organized into sections for easy navigation using anchor links in the navbar. Semantic HTML tags ensure the content is accessible and well-organized.

#### styles.css
Custom CSS file for styling the website. It includes responsive design elements to ensure the site looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. Special attention was given to typography and color schemes to match the wedding theme.

#### models.py
Contains the database schema, including models for:

DaysPresent: days of attendance.
GuestConfirmation: storage of RSVP data, such as names, attendance confirmation and days of attendance.
ConfirmationForm: form used to collect data from the guests.

#### Design Choices
Single Page Design
I chose a single-page layout for simplicity and user convenience. Guests can quickly navigate between sections without reloading the page, providing a seamless experience.

#### Custom CSS Over Bootstrap
Initially, Bootstrap was used for styling, but I transitioned to a custom CSS file to have full control over the website's design. This allowed me to tailor the visual elements to match the wedding's unique aesthetic.

#### Data Handling
Managing RSVP submissions required thoughtful database design to accommodate attendance details, and any special notes from guests.

This project reflects months of learning and dedication, combining technical skills with personal creativity. I hope this website not only serves its purpose for my wedding but also demonstrates my potential as a web developer.
